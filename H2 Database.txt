H2 database can be used to create a baseline for the applications where database is not ready but we want to check some part of the project

H2 database is in memory database where data will exist till the application is running and we will loss this data when we close the application

To use H2 database we need to add the dependency for H2 in the project

Spring JPA dependency will also need to be added in the project to work with the database

Repository is the interface which will contain the method that will be mapped with query to be given to the database
